Simplify the construction of large scale JavaScript applications

hyperion.js is a technology stack that will help you to create a single page application in easy way. hyperion.js is using all the best out there. After detailed investigation of many available frameworks we found this unique technology stack that is working perfectly for desktop and mobile applications.

## Our criteria:

### Reusable code
In case we want to change our library in a future we wanted to choose something that will allow use to reuse most of the code.

### Stability
How long product is currently on a market. When was the release of a stable version. How many bugs are there. If there are any major changes incoming.

### Support
Quality of documentation. How many thread on stackoverflow are there.

### Reason
Don’t go with the trends go with stability. Year ago Ember was number one. Right now it’s Angular. Which one will be next year?

### Flexibility
There are hundreds of awesome plug-ins and libraries out there that do specialized things. They usually do these things better than what comes bundle with a framework. So it important to be able to integrate these libraries with the chosen MVC framework.

### Size
Size matters – always. Sometimes size need to be smaller sometimes bigger :).

## Create a single page responsive application in 5 minutes

### No Page Refresh
This much is obvious, but are the benefits as immediately clear to designer? There’s a reason single-page sites are fast becoming standard on mobile. A site without page refreshing is like a buffet without a line – users get to exactly what they want when they want. Responsiveness increases tremendously, and backend maintenance becomes easier, too.

### Quality Over Quantity
With the burden of page-by-page design and optimization removed, developers can focus on a single, quality page. After all, let’s not kid ourselves – good design takes time and focus. The fewer pages you have to deal with, the better the overall user experience.

### Mobile Preferred
A slush pile of statistics reveals that mobile users are more likely to rage quit out of a slow-loading site (or a site with several slow-loading pages), than desktop/laptop users, who can afford to be slightly more patient. So it should come as no surprise that single-page sites are the responsive design paradigm of choice for the mobile market.

### Stand Out From The Crowd
Lastly, single-page sites are still not the norm. Use this to your advantage, and join the ranks of the swelling single-page crowd. Single-page design is (at least for now) associated with lean and smart startups. Use that mainstream appeal to your advantage.
